Zend-Socket
===========

This is a small project to implement PHP sockets with zend framework.
The Socket class used by fancywebsocket is used with modification. For more details on FancyWebSockets please visit the github url https://github.com/Flynsarmy/PHPWebSocket-Chat.git

Lets try to make it more compatible with zend-framework structure and get the best out of it.
